# Static Website
Using HTML and CSS, I created a responsive website called [Crochet Along](https://itsmeh-blah.github.io/Website/). A website where those who wish to learn or enjoy the art of crochet can visit. There they can purchase tools and materials, sign up for classes, and much more. This site was created using the various tecniques we learned this semester such as:

1. HTML Basics
